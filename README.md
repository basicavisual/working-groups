# Working Groups Hub (Proof of concept)

This is a work in progress, proof of concept, for a hub where we can hold all public information regarding Working Groups at [GovStack](http://govstack.global). It is not meant to be taken as operational in any way and it entails only a prototype that will serve to validate functionalities with WG members.

This site uses jekyll and ruby 3. 

Go `bundle install`
Then `bundle exec jekyll serve`
